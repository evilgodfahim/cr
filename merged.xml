But the law excludes those who have been prosecuted or convicted of promoting military action against the country - which could include opposition leaders like Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado, who has been accused by the ruling party of calling for international intervention like the one that ousted former...</description><media:content url="https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/d8/images/canvas/2026/02/20/45613335-937c-4096-bc4a-55712cf6e7db_a64e33c9.jpg?itok=QfsGClwI&amp;v=1771562925" medium="image"/></item><item><title>Trump says he’s ordering release of US files on UFOs and aliens</title><link>https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3344066/trump-says-hes-ordering-release-us-files-ufos-and-aliens?utm_source=rss_feed</link><guid>https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3344066/trump-says-hes-ordering-release-us-files-ufos-and-aliens?utm_source=rss_feed</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 03:12:48 +0000</pubDate><description>US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he was directing the Pentagon and other government agencies to identify and release files related to extraterrestrials and UFOs because of “tremendous interest”.
Trump made the announcement in a social media post hours after he accused former president Barack Obama of disclosing “classified information” when Obama recently suggested in a podcast interview that aliens were real.

Experts at Stanford Medicine ⁠in the US have developed a universal ⁠vaccine that could be given as a nasal spray and ⁠could protect against a wide range of respiratory viruses, bacteria and allergy triggers.
Although the study, published in the journal Science, was in mice, they said the vaccine offered broad protection in the lungs for several months.

Some appeared delighted that police were holding King Charles’ brother, arguing it sent the right message that the royal family was not above the law.
US President Donald Trump, meanwhile, called the arrest “very sad” on Thursday.

The case is the latest suspected instance of infanticide to emerge in France in recent years.

No one else has been charged, he added.
